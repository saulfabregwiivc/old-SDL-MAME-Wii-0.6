Make sure you have devkitPPC r19 or higher and the custom version of SDL-wii
installed. (See SDL/Readme.txt) Then run "make" from the folder.

If you wish to add debugging symbols, add "SYMBOLS=1" to the command. (Also be
sure to edit src/osd/sdl/sdlmain.c to initalize the debugging method of your
choice.) You can do a minimal build (only runs ROMs you can get from
mamedev.org) by running "make SUBTARGET=tiny"

If you have a dual or quad core, add "-j#" to the command. Good values for #
are usually the number of cores your computer has plus one.

The programs in the prec-build folder are needed for compiling. If you're
trying to build this from Linux/Mac/etc. you will have to compile a copy of
the tools yourself (not with these sources) and get the build apps from
obj\*\*\build folder and copy them over manually. You can make just the
nessisary executables and avoid compiling all of MAME by using
"make buildtools". (Also be sure to change the value of CCEXE in the makefile
to match your platform.) Because of the changes in SDL MAME Wii, you will have
to get the clean sources yourself, which can be found here:
